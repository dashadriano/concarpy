# Development
**concarpy** is basically a logic-powered, console-based car game. 

The name of the project is a play on the words console, car, and python.

It lacks a proper GUI as I was merely testing out my python logic during the creation of this. Just a small CLI-based game for now.

Playing **concarpy** requires all three Python files: `main.py`, `prompts.py`, and `conditions.py`.

Running the game will give you a basic layout of the commands, eventually leading to the game. Interact to check out command-logic interaction, or feel free to simply view logic on `conditions.py` and prompts at `prompts.py`.
